# SnowballR Frontend

Frontend of the SnowballR project.

## Use Cases

To keep track of the use cases we are working on, we are using the GitHub project board feature. You can find them [here](https://github.com/orgs/SE-UUlm/projects/2/views/7).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
